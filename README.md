### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Firebase account (for hosting and authentication)

- Cohere AI API key (for AI-based movie recommendations)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MoodShow.git
    cd MoodShow
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Set up your environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

```plaintext
REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_cohere_ai_api_key
```
### Run the app
To start the app, run the following command:
 ```bash
    npm start
 ```


## üåê API Integrations
- TMDB API: For fetching movie data and trailers.
- Cohere AI API: For generating movie recommendations based on user input.
- Firebase Authentication: For user sign-in with Google.

## üíª Key Components
- GptSearchBar: The AI-powered search bar that fetches recommendations from Cohere AI and TMDB.
- MovieList & MovieCard: Display movies in a grid layout with dynamic data from the TMDB API.
- MovieDetail: A detailed view of a selected movie that shows a trailer and additional information.

## üöÄ How It Works
### Authentication
- Users can sign in with Google through Firebase Authentication. Once signed in, they can browse and interact with the movie data.

### AI Movie Recommendations
- The GPT search bar allows users to type in a movie query. The app sends the query to Cohere AI, which returns a list of movie titles. These titles are then fetched from the TMDB API, and the results are displayed in the movie list.

### Movie Pages
- Each movie card leads to a detailed page where the trailer auto-plays, and additional movie information is displayed, such as the cast, crew, and description.
